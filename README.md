Collections Practice
We have discussed how arrays, lists, and dictionaries can each be used, and it's about time we put some of this knowledge into action. The following things should just be created in a new .NET project and uploaded at the end.

Objectives.
Creating variables
Initializing/Iterating collection types
Practice using built-in methods for Lists/Dictionaries

Exercises:

Three Basic Arrays.

Create an array to hold integer values 0 through 9
Create an array of the names "Tim", "Martin", "Nikki", & "Sara"
Create an array of length 10 that alternates between true and false values, starting with true

List of Flavors.

Create a list of ice cream flavors that holds at least 5 different flavors (feel free to add more than 5!)
Output the length of this list after building it
Output the third flavor in the list, then remove this value
Output the new length of the list (It should just be one fewer!)

User Info Dictionary.

Create a dictionary that will store both string keys as well as string values
Add key/value pairs to this dictionary where:
-each key is a name from your names array
-each value is a randomly select a flavor from your flavors list.
Loop through the dictionary and print out each user's name and their associated ice cream flavor
